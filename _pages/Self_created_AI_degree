During my master Business Information Management I got a great interest in machine learning and AI. 
I find the whole creative process of programming and AI fascinating and truly believe that this can help humanity to do and be better.  
I was inspired by Daniel Bourke's Self-Created AI Masters Degree which details the courses he's taking on his path to becoming a machine learning engineer. 
That's why I set up my own curriculum to become better in this field and to refine my skills that I learning during my studies.
