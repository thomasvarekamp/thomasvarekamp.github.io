During my master Business Information Management I got a great interest in machine learning and AI. 
I find the whole process of programming and creating AI fascinating and truly believe that this can help humanity to do and be better.  
Inspired by Daniel Bourke's Self-Created AI Masters Degree, I decided to set up my own curriculum refine my skills in this field.
