The amount of data that is generated this day far outpaces humans' ability to absorb, interpet and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial Intelligence is gaining momentum and is increasingly being implemented in complicated processes. Therefore I have refreshed, enlarged and deepened my knowledge of Artificial Intelligence, by thoroughly studying the newest Machine Learning concepts and techniques like feature engineering, regression, classification and natural language processing. Currently, I am able to implement most of the phases of the ML-life cycle (from data acquisition to results interpretation & visualisation). 

For this, I mostly use R (and its packages, including Rmarkdown, RShiny), Pyhon, SQL and Power BI. My strengths lie in translating business problems into practical solutions. To me, programming is an art which I use to add business value through insights, predictive modeling & process automatisation.
