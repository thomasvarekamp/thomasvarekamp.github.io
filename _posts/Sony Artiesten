In de bedrijfsbeschrijving van Sony Music Entertainment staat een lijst met artiesten die Sony representeert. Mijn hypothese is dat specifiek deze artiesten hier in staan om te laten zien dat Sony een veelzijdig roster aan artiesten vertegenwoordigd.


Maar, is dat ook zo?


De volgende artiesten worden genoemd: Beyoncé, BLØF, Bruce Springsteen, Calvin Harris, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Enrique Iglesias, Gavin James, George Ezra, Justin Timberlake, King Princess, Kygo, Little Mix, Mariah Carey, Martin Garrix, Nielson, Pharrell Williams, P!nk, Rosalía, Tom Walker en Travis Scott.


Ik ga eerst met behulp van de Spotify API gegevens ophalen van de artiesten en de liedjes. Vervolgens pak ik de gemiddelden van alle kenmerken van deze tracks. Hieronder vallen: acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, valence, tempo. Hier zal ik met behulp van een principal component analyse de dimensies reduceren om te onderzoeken of deze nieuwe dimensies bruikbare informatie bevatten en om de artiesten mee te onderscheiden.


*Spotify hanteert de volgende definities:*

acousticness: confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.

danceability: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.

energy: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

instrumentalness: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.

liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.

loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).

speechiness: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.

valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
